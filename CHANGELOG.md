# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are versioned with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## 0.11.1 — 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- The Wordkeep Atlas's `requestAnimationFrame` loop never stopped: its force
  sim doesn't settle (see 0.11.0), so the `moved <= 0.002` rest check the loop
  relied on almost never fired — the animation ran for as long as the case
  study page stayed open. `atlasSim.ts` gains `shouldAnimate` (+
  `IDLE_FRAME_BUDGET`, 260 ticks — the same budget `settle()` already uses for
  reduced motion): the idle entrance animation now stops after that budget
  regardless of `moved`; holding a drag always keeps it running. Unit-tested.
- `.github/workflows/production.yml` installed `vercel@41` for the manual
  production-deploy dispatch — four majors behind. Bumped to `vercel@59`.

### Removed

- Ten `UiCopy` keys nothing rendered: `aboutTitle`, `notFoundTitle`,
  `notFoundBody`, `errorTitle`, `errorBody`, `retryCta` (dead since v0.10.0
  made the error/404 boundaries static and English-only) and `role`
  (byte-identical duplicate of `headline`), `idea`, `expand`, `collapse`
  (leftovers from the fold accordion removed in v0.9.0). That's ten strings
  translated into six locales for nothing. New `copyUsage.test.ts` fails the
  suite if a `UiCopy` key stops being read anywhere in `app`/`components`/`lib`,
  so this doesn't silently reaccumulate — it's the guard the original Phase 3
  plan called for and never added.

### Docs

- `README.md`: list all three case studies (was just `iterm-studio`), and an
  Architecture section covering the server/client split, generated design
  tokens, and the extracted atlas simulation.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-09-06

### Atlas simulation extraction

- The Wordkeep Atlas's force layout moves out of `WordAtlas.tsx` into a pure
  `src/lib/atlasSim.ts`: `seedRing` (deterministic ring seed), `buildAdjacency`,
  `stepForces` (one physics tick, mutates in place), `settle` (run to a fixed
  tick count, used for the reduced-motion path), and `nodeAt` (pixel hit-test).
  No DOM, no canvas — unit-tested directly under the node project.
  `WordAtlas.tsx` keeps only canvas sizing, theme re-read, drawing, and pointer
  wiring, now calling into the extracted functions.
- While writing the extraction tests: the simulation's velocities don't
  actually settle — motion stays high and can grow for thousands of ticks
  (confirmed identical in the original code, so this predates the extraction,
  not a regression from it). Positions stay bounded regardless, because the
  per-tick clamp is unconditional, so the visible layout doesn't run away —
  but `loop()`'s `moved <= 0.002` rest check most likely never fires, so the
  animation frame loop runs for as long as the atlas is on screen rather than
  settling and going idle. Filed as a follow-up, not fixed here.
- Coverage: `atlasSim.ts` is 100% covered; global `functions` coverage rose
  71→73%, so `vitest.config.ts`'s `functions` threshold moves 70→73 (still
  short of the other three thresholds — the remaining gap is `WordAtlas.tsx`'s
  canvas/pointer closures, which need a real 2D context and are covered by the
  Playwright e2e suite instead).

## 0.10.0 — 2026-09-06

### Server / client boundary

- `Desk` is a Server Component again. It was one ~350-line `"use client"` blob
  that imported the whole six-locale `copy` map, so every visitor downloaded five
  locales they can't read plus the entire desk render tree. Now the desk renders
  on the server with only `copy[locale]`, and the interactive bits are small
  client islands:
  - `SpotlightLayer` — the `.desk` shell; wires the pointer-spotlight and takes
    the server-rendered content as `children`.
  - `LanguageSwitcher` reads `usePathname()` itself and takes `langLabel` as a
    prop; `ThemeSwitcher` takes `label` + `names`; `SignalBoard` takes a
    `strings` object; `TraceTheater` takes `strings`. None import `copy`.
- `app/[locale]/error.tsx` is English-only now, like `global-error.tsx` and
  `not-found.tsx` — an error boundary sits in every route's tree, so importing
  `copy` there shipped all of it site-wide.
- Result: no non-English locale copy in the client bundle on the main routes
  (checked by `clientBundle.test.ts`, which fails if a `"use client"` file
  imports the `copy` barrel). Raw client JS on `/` drops ~840 KB → ~645 KB.

### Scannable desk

- The home page is no longer an accordion. Every section — selected work,
  experience, stack, contact, signal, education — renders open and stacked, so a
  visitor scanning for twenty seconds sees the whole thing on one scroll instead
  of a column of collapsed headers. Sections are split by a hairline with real
  breathing room (`.sheet` / `.section`, on the new spacing scale).
- Selected work now leads, before the CV history.
- The one thing that still folds is **More** (lab ideas + extra repos) — a native
  `<details>`, collapsed by default, genuinely optional depth.
- Removed the fold machinery: `useFoldScroll` / `foldScroll` (a scroll listener +
  rAF + keyboard + a pin-quiet window that existed only to drive the accordion),
  the `Fold` component, and the `j` / `k` section-jump plus its footer hint copy.
  Nav links are plain in-page anchors with `scroll-margin-top`. ~14 tests for the
  deleted code went with it; new tests assert every section is present and only
  the archive collapses (`Desk.test.tsx`, `smoke.spec.ts`, `mobile.spec.ts`).

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-06

### Design tokens

- **One source of truth for theme colour.** The `:root` / `[data-theme="…"]` custom-property blocks are now generated into `src/app/styles/tokens.css` from `THEME_PALETTES` in `src/lib/themePalettes.ts` (`tokensCssFile()` → `scripts/gen-tokens.mjs`, run at `prebuild` and as `npm run gen:tokens`). `globals.css` no longer declares a theme block, so the palette can't drift between the TS object and the stylesheet. `tokens.test.ts` fails the suite if the committed file is stale; `theme.test.ts` / `contrast.test.ts` now assert against the palette object directly.
- Hand-written scales gathered in `src/app/styles/scales.css`: the existing radius scale plus new spacing (`--s-1…--s-20`, 4px base), type (`--t-xs…--t-3xl`), line-height and z-index (`--z-skip`, `--z-tip`, `--z-heading`) ladders.
- **Cascade layers.** `globals.css` opens `@layer reset, tokens, base, components;` and wraps its rules accordingly, so a component rule can never lose to a reset selector on specificity and future utilities get a layer that always wins. The `@media print` and `prefers-reduced-motion` blocks are intentionally left unlayered so they still override everything.
- `package.json` is now `"type": "module"` (all scripts and configs were already ESM or explicitly `.cjs`).

### UI

- The language switcher's desktop row is now flag chips — a small inline-SVG flag per locale with its code on a dark plate over it (legible on any flag in either theme); the active locale gets a brass plate and outline. `en` is the Union Jack, `ca` the Catalan senyera. Spacing opened up from the old 2px. New `src/components/Flag.tsx`; the mobile `<select>` is unchanged.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-04

- **Wordkeep** joins featured work with a `/work/wordkeep` case study. The page embeds **The Atlas** — a frozen snapshot of Wordkeep's semantic graph (56 words, 90 links, four languages), drawn on a canvas with a tiny self-contained force layout, no graph library. Drag a word to move it, tap or click one to read its synonym / antonym / translation / related links in a small inline readout; the legend and colours come from the desk's own tokens. Two links out: the live 3D atlas and the Wordkeep app.
- Fix: the embed shipped hover-only, so it did nothing on a touchscreen — worse, `touch-action: pan-y` handed a finger-drag to page scroll before the canvas's own pointer handlers ever saw it. Click/tap now drives a persistent selection (works identically for mouse and touch) and nodes are properly draggable; `touch-action: none` lets the canvas claim its own gestures.
- `src/data/wordAtlas.ts` holds the snapshot and its localized micro-copy; `WordAtlas.tsx` is the client component. Unit tests for both, an axe check on the render, and e2e coverage (`e2e/atlasHit.ts`) driving a real mouse click and a real touchscreen tap through the actual selection.
- Dev-only: `next dev` serves an eval-tolerant CSP (`script-src … 'unsafe-eval'`) so React 19's development-mode stack reconstruction stops tripping the policy and logging a console error. The shipped production CSP is unchanged — still no `unsafe-eval` — and the swap is gated on `NODE_ENV` in `next.config.ts`. `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DEV` in `src/lib/securityHeaders.ts`, covered in `security.test.ts` / `headers.test.ts`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-02

### Rendering

- The whole localized site is statically prerendered again. The root layout no longer reads a per-request value, so `/`, `/<locale>`, `/work/<slug>`, `/print` and `/lab/trace` ship as static HTML instead of rendering on every request. The `<html>`/`<body>` shell, fonts, JSON-LD and anti-flash script moved into `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.
- Added a `global-error` boundary with its own shell for failures in the root layout itself.
- Single self-contained 404 surface (`app/not-found.tsx`) with its own shell; it is English-only so it can stay static.

### UI

- One shared corner-radius scale (`--r-xs` … `--r-lg`, plus the pill). The language `<select>`, the section headers, cards, the contact panel, tooltips and the trace textarea were square-cornered (or `border-radius: 0`); they now round consistently. Each fold reads as a soft rounded panel — collapsed, just its heading bar; open, a bordered tinted panel with the header flush to the top.

### SEO & polish

- `robots.txt` now `Disallow`s `/print` and `/lab` (bare and locale-prefixed), and those routes also send `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` — honoured even when the HTML is never parsed.
- Every sitemap entry carries the full hreflang alternate set (incl. `x-default`), not just the `<head>`.
- Adaptive `theme-color` / `color-scheme` meta so mobile browser chrome tracks the light/dark palette instead of one hard-coded colour.
- `/api/health` reports `releasedAt` so the signal board can date the running build.

### Refactor

- `src/data/copy.ts` (1133 lines) split into `src/data/copy/<locale>.ts` — one file per locale — with a thin barrel assembling the maps. Verified byte-identical output. Locale-independent `skills` / `contact` moved to `copy/shared.ts`.
- The `/api/vitals` and `/api/errors` rate limiters are one shared `src/lib/rateLimit.ts`.
- Playwright now also runs a `mobile` (Pixel 7) project covering the compact header's language `<select>`.

### Fixes

- Sitemap `lastModified` is pinned to the release date instead of `new Date()`, so it no longer tells crawlers every URL changed on every fetch.
- Fold navigation (`j`/`k`/arrows) no longer fights the scroll listener: a short quiet window after a programmatic pin stops `openId` bouncing back.
- Pointer spotlight writes are coalesced to one per animation frame.
- Proof line emphasises every curated token, including the Italian "Barcellona" the old English-only check missed.

### Testing & CI

- Vitest now runs a `node` project for pure logic and a `jsdom` project for components and hooks. New behaviour tests replace the source-string assertions in `proxy` and `signalLayout`, and cover the previously untested `useFoldScroll`, `foldScroll`, `prefs`, `spotlight`, `github`, `sitemap`, `og`, `robots`, `next.config` headers, and every component (`Desk`, `SignalBoard`, `TraceTheater`, `Fold`, `Emphasize`, `ThemeSwitcher`, `LanguageSwitcher`, `PrintDesk`, error boundaries). 53 → 130+ tests.
- A translation-drift test fails if a non-English locale's prose fields are left as the English copy.
- `vitest-axe` fails the build on WCAG violations in the rendered desk.
- Coverage (v8) is collected and gated in `npm run ci`.
- Playwright smoke suite (`npm run test:e2e`) drives a local production build: home, locale switch, theme persistence, keyboard folds, print CV, `/api/health`, 404.
- Lighthouse CI runs against that local build instead of `https://marcfors.com/`, three runs, asserting performance / accessibility / SEO scores plus CLS, LCP and TBT — so a regression fails the PR, not the deploy.
- CI splits into `verify` and `e2e` jobs.

### Hardening

- Error observability, first-party only: `onRequestError` in `instrumentation.ts` logs structured server errors, and a `/api/errors` beacon (rate-limited, size-capped, validated) receives client-boundary reports from `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx`. No third-party SDK, so the CSP stays intact.
- `github.ts` sends an optional `Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN` to lift the unauthenticated shared-IP rate limit, and logs when the repo fetch fails instead of silently returning an empty list.
- `@types/node` bumped to `^22` to match the Node version.

Deferred (follow-up): splitting `copy.ts` into per-locale files, `@layer`-ing `globals.css`, and a hash/nonce CSP. A nonce CSP needs per-request rendering, which would undo the static generation above; Next's own inline bootstrap scripts have build-varying hashes, so `script-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'` for now.
