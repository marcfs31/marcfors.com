 * Single 404 for the whole site. It renders its own `<html>` / `<body>` because
 * the root layout is a bare pass-through.
 *
 * It is intentionally static and English-only: reading a per-request value here
 * opts the entire route tree back into on-demand rendering, which would undo the
 * static generation of every localized page. Nested `not-found` boundaries inside
 * `[locale]` are not reliably reached by `notFound()` from descendant pages, so
 * this is the one 404 surface.
